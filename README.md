To internet wanderers:
  For a stable version of whatever you are looking for go to version#...py files
  For easy MPU6050 Gyroscope Access go to gyroscope.py
  For everything else, well, you will have to do some digging. Good luck!

Note: You would need to download ir_hasher.py for the remote to work
