# Longboard LED awesomeness

1. WS2812b LED Strip
2. MPU 6050 Gyroscope
3. Some Chinese Remote controller with KY-022 receiver
4. BlueDot Bluetooth connection

To internet wanderers:

  1. For a stable version of whatever you are looking for go to version#...py files
  2. For easy MPU6050 Gyroscope Access go to gyroscope.py
  3. For everything else, well, you will have to do some digging. Good luck!

Note: You would need to download ir_hasher.py for the remote to work
